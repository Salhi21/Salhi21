# Hello there 😃
I am Salhi Nassim, and I am a Business Computing student at the Higher Institute of Management Tunis 🏫 majoring in Business Information Systems.

- 👋  I'm currently learning the basics of front-end and back-end development
- 👀 I’m interested in the MEAN stack (and not because of the catchy name 👀).
- 🌱 I’m currently working on an online [Task Manager](https://github.com/Salhi21/task-manager)📓 using the stack mentioned above.
- 🥅 2022 Goals : Javascript mastery 🥇.
